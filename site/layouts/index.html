<p>And as I'm blinking in and out of consciousness she speaks to me in a voice that comes from just behind my ear, she says, </br>
"All that has ever mattered is <i>volume</i>, and if you turn up the speakers past </br >
the point of sound into deafening silence you will hear me <b>again</b>.</p>
<p>"I will speak your name through the cracks in the canyon rocks, and you will know </br> 
that <i>this</i> is heaven." </p>
